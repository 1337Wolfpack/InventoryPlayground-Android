InventoryPlayground-Android
===========================

Hello,

This is my first android app, and first java app.
I have wrote some python code, but at a beginner level.

This is my learning project. I hope to build a maintainable inventory system, and integrate it to various tools.

The logic of the app will be very clear soon.

If you'd like to contribute, please follow this draft roadmap : 

The project will mainly use 4 tabs :

-  1 : first is quick list of the computers that can be expanded by clicking them, and on each child views.
       I have to build an efficient query that will pull most of the data from the db and build a view like this.
  
Location     
      Computer1
          Screens : [21,21] (inches)
          IP : xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
          OsVersion : Fedora 12
          ...
          PrimaryUser fullname


properties will be displayed in a different color or theme than assets,
Long click can get Asset Specific details like contracts/bills/...

- 2 : details from one computer 
- 3 : scan view will trigger scan and ask for details if asset is unknown
- 4 : Ticket View. Tickets will be imported/updated from some tool, I will use generic XML web service, so it can be integrated later on other tools. 

Have fun if you want to start coding with me, no problem -

I plan on doing and interface for tablets. (dual pane) later on.)

Target is android 4.0
